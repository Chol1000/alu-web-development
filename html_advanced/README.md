# HTML Advanced Project

## Overview

This project involves creating a webpage from scratch based on a designer file. The focus is on building a semantic HTML page—no CSS or JavaScript is involved at this stage. The goal is to construct a webpage that accurately reflects the wireframe provided in Figma.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- **Understand HTML**: Explain what HTML is and its role in web development.
- **Create an HTML Page**: Build an HTML page from a wireframe.
- **Markup Language**: Define what a markup language is and its purpose.
- **Document Object Model (DOM)**: Describe what the DOM is and its relationship to HTML.
- **HTML Elements and Tags**: Explain what elements/tags are and their purposes.
- **Attributes**: Understand the role of attributes in HTML.

## Project Requirements

- **Files**: Ensure all files end with a newline.
- **Dependencies**: No external libraries allowed. Build the website using only HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
- **Compliance**: Your code should be W3C compliant and validate with the W3C Validator.
